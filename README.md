## Investment

API for personal use. The main goal is to store data investment receipts. And with this data calculates interests, incomes, outcomes, etc.

Besides that, the app is a developer case too. I'm training clear architecture (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and Ent ORM framework (https://entgo.io/).
